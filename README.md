# Military Vehicle Maintenance Assistant (Mock Data)

This project is a re-creation of the data processing workflow I performed during my military service as the **primary driver of the battalion commander’s vehicle (1st Vehicle Driver)**.  
Due to confidentiality, all data has been replaced with mock datasets, but the **logic, structure, and engineering approach** reflect real operations.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Military vehicles require continuous inspection and maintenance under harsh conditions.  
However, tracking maintenance history and predicting failures manually is inefficient.

This system:
- organizes maintenance logs  
- analyzes fault patterns  
- predicts next maintenance cycle  
- provides a clean status dashboard

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn  
- FastAPI  
- Matplotlib/Seaborn  
- Docker  

---

## 📊 Features
- Data preprocessing pipeline  
- Maintenance prediction model  
- REST API for vehicle status queries  
- Dashboard for visual insights  
- Modular architecture  

---

## 🚀 Results
- Clear improvement in maintenance scheduling visibility  
- Automated reporting reduced manual workload (simulated)  
- Real-world military workflow successfully abstracted into code  

---

## 📌 Future Work
- Add anomaly detection  
- Build frontend UI  
- Expand dataset
