# Military Vehicle Maintenance Assistant (Mock Data)

This system is a re-creation of the maintenance and operational workflow I experienced during my military service as the **1st Vehicle Driver (battalion commander’s vehicle)**.  
All datasets are simulated to protect confidentiality, but the engineering logic reflects real procedures: tracking vehicle usage, analyzing fault history, and predicting maintenance needs.

## 🚀 Project Overview
Military vehicles operate under demanding conditions and require frequent inspections.  
This project transforms the manual workflow into a **data-driven maintenance prediction system**.

### ✔ What the System Does
- Cleans and structures maintenance logs  
- Extracts operational features  
- Trains an ML model to predict `days_until_next_maintenance`
- Serves predictions through a FastAPI backend  
- Provides a visualization notebook for insights

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Python** (pandas, scikit-learn, joblib)
- **FastAPI**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Modular Architecture**
